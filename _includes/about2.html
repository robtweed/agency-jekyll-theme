		  <p class="text-muted">Open Source has 3 key virtues</p>  
			<ul>
			  <li class="text-muted">Unconstrained innovation – ideas and ambitions can be shared by folk who are oceans apart</li>
			  <li class="text-muted">Transparent credibility -allowing immediate detailed scrutiny immediately boosts credibility</li>
			  <li class="text-muted">Decentralized control – amendments and improvement can come from the bottom up</li>
